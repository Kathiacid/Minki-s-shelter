        <p id="about-us">
          We are Minki's Shelter, founded in 2025 after Minki passed away, our beloved cat who touched the hearts of everyone around him. In honor of his spirit and the love he gave us, we created this sanctuary to continue his legacy by offering care, support, and hope to cats in need. Our mission is to provide a safe haven for cats who have nowhere else to turn, just as Minki did for so many during his life.
